Welcome aleksandrsg,

### Final Milestone Project 4 with Django Framework
---

Web Project Adopt a Pet developed on Django framework together with other web languages and technologies  
like Stripe (e-commerce functionality implementation), Bootstrap (responsive design) ect.  
Frameworks like Django or Flask helped me to see clear full picture of web development process   
from front-end till back-end development.  

## UX  
---
Project wireframe you could find in directory Static / Wireframes.

As a Web Resource owner I could:  

- Manage and store Database with pets who need homes;
- Create, Update, Delete data from Database;
- Receive donations for Project development;
- Receive comments from persons who have adopted the pets

As a Web Resource user I could:

- Make donation to support a Project;
- Leave a comment to owner and for other users;
- Find a pet for adoption;
